Hi there, and thanks for applying to join the core FLE dev team!
To give you a chance to demonstrate how you approach a problem,
using a variety of technologies and a healthy dose of creative
freedom, we've put together this short practice project. To make
it a bit faster for you to get started, we put together this
skeleton repository that you can use as a starting point.

Within this repository's `starter/data/` folder is a `movies.json`
file, which is a snapshot of the Rotten Tomatoes API. Your task is to
display all the movies (e.g. in a list), and allow the user to view details
of a movie once it's clicked. You can use whatever technologies and
methods you'd like to accomplish this task; the only requirement is to
use Django as the backend web framework. You can also add other features
such as search or filtering, make it a single-page JS app, or focus on
making it pretty, etc.

So to get things started, do the following:

1. Clone this repo into your local machine (DO NOT FORK!)
2. Create a new repository in your github account
3. Change your local repository's origin remote to point to your new remote Github repository
4. Once you're satisfied with your code, push your local repository into the remote Github repository
5. Send us the link to your Github repo!

That's it! We'll review your code soon and get back to you once we're done!
